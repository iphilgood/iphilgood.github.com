Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Phil Good and I'm a Software Engineer. I'm currently working at [Calydo](http://www.calydo.com) and studying part time Computer Science at the [HSR](http://www.hsr.ch) in Rapperswil, Switzerland.

I like to call myself a Software Engineer with pretty awesome front-end skills. I'm passionate about fancy designs and Ruby is the language I've fallen in love since we first met. I also like my sugar with coffee and cream.
